### ðŸ“± Phoneword Translator App (.NET MAUI)

This is a simple .NET MAUI application that translates alphanumeric phonewords (e.g., "CALLNOW") into their numeric equivalent based on a standard telephone keypad layout (e.g., "2255669").

**Features:**

* Clean, cross-platform UI built with .NET MAUI
* Translates input text to numeric digits (e.g., "cab" â†’ "222")
* Uses .NET MAUI Essentials to enable native phone dialing
* Compatible with Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS

This project demonstrates core concepts of building cross-platform mobile apps with .NET MAUI, including UI layout, event handling, and integration with native device features.
